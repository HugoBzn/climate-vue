# Climate Forecast

This app works like a weather consultant, you can search for a city and this app will tell you about the weather in that city. üå¶Ô∏è

This App uses an API from OpenWeather.
To use this application you need to create an account in openweather and add your API key in env file, read the env file to understand what you need to do.

This idea is from a course made it by Juan de la Torre (Udemy) ü§ì.
